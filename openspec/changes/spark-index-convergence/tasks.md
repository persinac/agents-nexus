## 1. P1 — Build the canonical bedrock index alongside the live one

- [x] 1.1 Choose + create the canonical index path — reusing `~/.spark-index/bedrock-full` for now (P3 may rename to a stable `~/.spark-index/the-index` + symlink)
- [x] 1.2 Run `spark reclaim` with bedrock — done this session: 438 installs, 40,338 chunks @ 1024d in ~22min, 0 zero-vectors
- [x] 1.3 Confirm the live 768d `guilty-spark` index is untouched and still serving during the build — confirmed (separate path)

## 2. P2 — Verify parity against the new index

- [x] 2.1 Verify row count (40,338) and vector dim = 1024 — confirmed
- [x] 2.2 Spot-check semantic `spark query` via bedrock — "claims adjudication state machine" → svc-claims-adjudication; 1024d match, no dim error
- [x] 2.3 Verify `query_registry`/`registry` filters — fastify→13, python+backend→197
- [ ] 2.4 Verify `installation_summary` + `list_installations` against the new index
- [x] 2.5 Confirm `installations.json` carries `detected` for all installs — 438/438

## 3. P3 — Atomic cutover of all serving surfaces

- [x] 3.1 Set canonical `agents-nexus/spark/.env`: `SPARK_EMBEDDER=bedrock`, `SPARK_INDEX_PATH=~/.spark-index/bedrock-full`, `AWS_PROFILE`/`AWS_REGION`; verified canonical spark resolves to bedrock with no env overrides
- [ ] 3.2 Back up `/usr/local/bin/spark` (done → /tmp/spark-wrapper.bak); repoint it (sudo, one line) to run canonical `agents-nexus/spark` ← **YOUR STEP**
- [ ] 3.3 Update `docker-compose.work.yml` `nexus-spark`: `SPARK_EMBEDDER=bedrock`, index path, and inject AWS creds (mount `~/.aws` or env); recreate the container
- [ ] 3.4 Relaunch local MCP/sessions so the stdio MCP picks up canonical code + new index
- [ ] 3.5 Smoke-test each surface post-cutover: local MCP `spark`/`query_registry`, container SSE `:8343`, and a webhook/MR-review path

## 4. P4 — Retire legacy

- [ ] 4.1 Archive the `guilty-spark` checkout (keep on disk as fallback; do not delete)
- [ ] 4.2 Remove dead config layers (stale `.env`/`config.yaml` index/embedder pins)
- [ ] 4.3 After a soak period, drop the old 768d (`guilty-spark/data/the-index`) and partial 384d (`~/.spark-index/the-index`) indexes

## 5. P5 — Re-wire nightly + document

- [ ] 5.1 Confirm the nightly `spark sync` (`spark/scripts/spark-pipeline.sh`) resolves to the canonical bedrock index and embedder
- [ ] 5.2 Watch one nightly run (first run is a full reclaim at the new path) and confirm it completes + writes metadata
- [ ] 5.3 Document the converged topology (single codebase/index/embedder) and the SSO→IAM-key hardening follow-up in docs/ or memory

## 6. Follow-up (not blocking)

- [ ] 6.1 Provision a scoped `bedrock:InvokeModel` IAM key and switch serving creds off SSO (removes query-time rotation failures)
